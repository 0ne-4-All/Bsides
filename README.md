This project was created to help get experience in cloud/security concepts from home. It is difficult to know where to begin and what to focus on. This lab is designed to help touch on many concepts in a safe environment and affordable practice. First we will begin explaining the resources utilized in Azure and how to set them up from a manual process. Then we will show how to autmoate the infrastructure using Hashicorp's Terraform platform in Azure.
