This project was created to help get experience in cloud/security concepts from home. It is difficult to know where to begin and what to focus on. This lab is designed to help touch on many concepts in a safe environment and affordable practice. First we will begin explaining the resources utilized in Azure and how to set them up from a manual process. Then we will show how to autmoate the infrastructure using Hashicorp's Terraform platform in Azure.

Manual Azure setup: 

Step 1. Create an Azure Subscription - First, you will need a subscription. This subscription will be tied to an email address and used to build the resources within. Azure offers a $200 credit for the first 30 days of use and is plenty of time to test and understand the concepts. Click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) to begin this process.
